# NODE JS

## Intro
This is my personal project to study the back-end side with using Node.JS

## What is Node JS?
* Node js is a Javascript runtime built on Chrome's V8 Javascript Engine
    * runtime is the final phase of a computer program's life cycle
    * runtime is the running phase of a program

* It's a software platform used in server side application development

* It has high performace in processing requests by **non-blocking I/O**, **single thread** and **event loop**

* When expressing huge amount of data from a data base to a web page, normaly it takes time to show all of them because blocking happens when processing those database.
* Every APIs in Node works asynchronously, so non-blocking I/O is possible and high performace in request management is possible by single threaded event loop model
* Node.js is appropriate in SPA(Single Page Application) which alot of real-time data needs to be dealed with and lots of I/O
* Do not recommend in applications requires high usage in CPU
